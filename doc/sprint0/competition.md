SPORTCRED COMPETITION

We are making the next big sports analyst and debating app. Which features updates 
for your favourite teams and scores. Also, gives users the chance to test their knowledge
by having trivia, debates, and a place to have picks and predictions. A scoring 
system to actually quantify results. Access to all this will require the user to make an 
account and profile. 

OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

Yahoo Fantasy Leagues and Drafts
https://basketball.fantasysports.yahoo.com
Both products have the ability to have picks and "mock drafts" and give 
specific player information/news and scores. However, SPORTCRED has trivia and 
debate features where users can express their knowlege and opinions. Our product is
better for users that care more about general team updates and for users that don't want
to just have an app for having picks. As Yahoo Fanatasy doesn't give updates for teams but instead 
they focus on certain players. Also, fantasy is used for drafts and leagues to create 
"fantasy" teams so they do not need to implement a debate function as the person with the 
best team is seen to be the expert.


The Score
https://www.thescore.com
Just like SPORTCRED, The Score is used to get your latest scores and updates for both
your favourite teams and individual players. For SPORTCRED you need an account, 
but the Score you don't need a profile. However, our product offers the chance to communicate 
as a community in OPENCOURT feature. Also, SPORTCRED has the features of trivia and debate which
the Score lacks as they are only for articles and sports news. For them to integrate these features 
they would need some rebranding, remarketing, and they would need to add many pages and sections 
in their applications to accommodate these changes. 


ESPN APP
https://www.espn.com
Just like SPORTCRED, ESPN app is used to get your latest scores and updates for both
your favourite teams and individual players. Both, products include picks, predictions, 
and trivia. ESPN also includes some options to stream live and watch highlights. While, SPORTCRED
has OPENCOURT to encourage communication and build a community of sports analyst. Our app is better 
for users that want to prove their analyst skills because we have resources for practice and 
we have a scoring system to quantify a persons ability of being an analyst. Which ESPN lacks. 
ESPN is better for situations that you want to listen to analysts while SPORTCRED is better 
in situations where the user wants to be or thinks they are an analyst. ESPN didn't 
focus on this because they wanted to be the ones marketing media with their own experts, and 
didn't focus on helping others prove their expertise. I don't think they can do this as they 
will be going against their nature of being an media providing company.

**SUMMARY**<br/>

**Objective**<br/> 
Build a social media application where users can play sports trivia games, participate in sports debates and discussions, and make predictions about future sports games and events. Users are associated with a score that increases or decreases based on their level of analytical ability and participation within the app. This score, along with a history of their activity on the app, is displayed on their user profile. Users can also view and publish posts, and see of the scores of live games. The goal of this application is to provide a platform dedicated to user-based sports analysis which can be used for fun or as a means to advance one's career in the sports industry.

**Key Persona 1**<br/>
Frank Jean is a novice sports fan. He finds it difficult to expand his knowledge on sports topics and is often unable to contribute to discussions with his friends. Frank wishes to learn more about sports and prove to his friends that he knows what he is talking about.

**Key Persona 2**<br/>
Jonathan Grant is a casual sports fan who likes watching his favourite teams and competing in debates and games with his friends. He thinks that he is always right and likes asserting his opinion on others.

**Key Persona 3**<br/>
Jessica Jones is avid sports fan who loves watching sports games and talking about sports with family and friends. She has a deep knowledge about the subject and is often accurate in her analyses. Jessica wants to build a reputation for her analytical ability and voice her opinion to a wider audience.

**Key Scenario 1**<br/>
Frank has tried watching game highlights and reading news about current sport topics. However, he has a hard time finding information that is relevant to the discussions he has with friends. Frank needs a convenient way to learn about common sports debate topics and put his skills to the test. 

**Key Scenario 2**<br/>
Jonathan often voices his opinion on sports topics in the comment sections of social media posts, but the audiences are not very receptive to his remarks. He also likes playing games like fantasy sports, but finds that they sometimes require too much commitment. Therefore, Jonathan is looking for a new way to interact with others in the sports community, keep up to date on sports news, and participate in meaningful discussions with other people who actually care.

**Key Scenario 3**<br/>
Jessica has a deep knowledge about sports and believes that she can become a sports analyst. She is good at predicting award-winners and game outcomes, and applies statistics and logic to make valid arguments about sports topics. However, Jessica does not have the right connections to get herself into the industry. Therefore, she needs a way to build and prove her credability as a sports analyst. 

**Key Principle 1**<br/>
ACS Scoring System<br/>The design should strictly enforce the Analytical Credibility Score system to ensure only knowledgeable and active users earn credibility. The system should not be gameable, and the analyst rankings should take effort to grow and maintain.

**Key Principle 2**<br/>
Credibility<br/>The application should provide users with a way to build credibility as a sports analyst. This means that content on the app should be important, relevant, and similar to what is discussed by mainstream sports analysts.

**Key Principle 3**<br/>
Casual and non-casual features<br/>While the application emphasizes critical sports analysis, it should also cater to other users who might only want to keep up to date on news and scores. The Open Court feature in particular should tailor content to the user's interests.

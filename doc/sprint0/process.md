## How We Organized The Team, and Tools We Used
Our team was able to successfully work together by having daily conversations through messaging on Discord. We also used Discord’s voice chat feature to have discussions 
during any meetings or workshops held by Ilir or potential clients. We divided the roles of our team by evenly assigning tasks to each team member based on their strong suit during a group discussion, and making sure that everyone is content with what they have been assigned. For Sprint 0, everyone was satisfied and had no complaints about their assigned task, but should the need to reassign tasks arise, we are perfectly happy to do so, in order to maintain a positive team environment.

Tools we used to organized our team include Google Drive and Docs to share documents. These documents include notes about our 
clients, rough notes about what needs to be accomplished, and an agenda for everyone to see what tasks need to be done by who, and when. This platform was especially useful, 
as it allowed for real time editting of the documents aross all users. To add on, Jira was used to organize User Stories by adding their importance and including a 
“Conditions of Satisfaction” section in their descriptions. Jira is very useful, as it allows the team to easily view tasks, and mark them as completed by simply pushing
their work onto GitHub, as the two software development platforms are linked.

## How We Made Decisions
We made decisions by thoroughly discussing the positive and negative aspects of the topic at hand, and asking for each group member’s input to ensure our decision as a 
team is optimal. For example, to determine which client we would serve, it was determined that everyone was more comfortable developing software for SportsCred, because 
we knew more about what kind of application SportsCred desired, and had clear goals in mind we could tackle and accomplish compared to UImpactify.

## Coming Up With User Stories
Our team prioritised user stories based on how effectively it would satisfy important features given by our client, SportsCred, and how well such a feature would define or make our software stand out against our competitors. For instance, having a debate section and points system are some of the main features of the software that SportsCred desires, 
and is also the feature of their application which is unique to its competition. And so, any user stories relating to those would be prioritised. One or two rounds of voting were needed to come to a consensus for the point estimate. Our team would collaboratively come up with a reasonable point estimate together, so the amount of voting sessions conducted were scarce. 

## How We Met Up
Because of coronavirus and the fact that our team lives far apart from each other, it was decided that we would hold online meetings through Discord, as described above. 
We held full team meetings at around twice a week, and had optional drop in calls during any lectures or workshops. Our current plan is to hold full team meetings twice a 
week on Mondays at 2pm, and Wednesdays at 6pm. However, this may be changed, depending on any inconveniences which may occur, such as a conflict with one's class times.

## Lessons To Learn
A lesson we should take forward to the next phase is to plan out our meetings more effectively as it was learned that holding a 7-person call was sometimes inefficient, as 
the tasks needed to be accomplished were simple, and only required individual effort to complete. More effort into planning effective meetings could reduce wasted time, and
make our discussions clear, concise, and informative.

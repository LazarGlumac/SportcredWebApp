# Sprint 3 Restrospective Meeting

## Date and Time of Meeting
- Date: December 3, 2020
- Time: 10:10 to 11:00

## Participants
* Ryan Blasetti
* Aum Patel
* Parth Patel
* King Lai
* Lazar Glumac
* Jaedon Wong
* Yara Radwan

## Unfinished Tasks
* All tasks were finished this sprint

## Practices To Continue (What went well)
* Efficiency - All tasks completed early into the sprint leaving ample time to prepare for demo/bugs
* Teamwork - Team members maintained a good line of communication to complete tasks in timely manner
* Perfect attendance - Team members showed up to every meeting on time
* Initiative - Team members took initiative to complete their tasks and work well within the team
* Researching - Most people took time to thoroughly understand APIs/tasks before implementation

## New Practices To Start
* Spread work out over the sprint instead of piling it all at once so that we dont keep commenting "No Updates" for scrums
* Better read the rubric in advance to avoid cramming in tasks for the PB to meet rubric requirements

## Harmful Practices (What went wrong)
* Binging Work - Completed all work in one lump sum not allowing it to spread out over sprint (odd burndown chart)
* Lack of attention to detail - Did not notice small changes in the rubric causing us to lose marks in earlier sprints

## Best Experience
* Completing all work in advance leaving ample time to review code and discuss further improvements

## Worst Experience
* Typing "No updates" for about 5 days straight in the standup channel after completing all work early in sprint

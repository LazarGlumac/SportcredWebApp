* Independant Work - Team members worked very well to complete tasks given with little overall supervision from other team members
* Innovation - Team members developed and implemented great features that went beyond expectations
* Completion - Team members were quick to develop the backend and maintain it throughout testing phases.

## New Practices To Start
* Looking ahead during planning phase to ensure work does not overlap with exams/other courses
* Starting work earlier to avoid last minute stress

## Harmful Practices (What went wrong)
* Planning - Bulk of work had to be done too close to exam causing a lot of unneccesary stress for the team
* Cohesion - Code someitmes did not match well with each other and made it hard to put together at the end of the sprint


## Best Experience
* Receiving the email from the forgot password feature when we got it working

## Worst Experience
* Spending two hours after the exam putting all of the code together and setting up a practice demo

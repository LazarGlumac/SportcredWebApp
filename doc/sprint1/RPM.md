## Project Scope
#### SportCred App
The purpose of our software is to develop a sports analyst and debate app. Many sport apps exist in the market, but do not allow users to express their knowledge in the analytical aspect of sports. 

Examples of these apps include: Yahoo Fantasy league, The Score, and ESPN APP (all listed in doc/sprint0/competition.md). These three apps allow the user to make fantasy teams, predict outcomes of games, watch games, and view news about one's favorite team, or general sports. 
However, they all lack the ability to allow someone to improve and develop their analytical skills. 

And so, our software will introduce debating and analysing of sports, and still have the features of a general purpose sports app. This type of application is not seen in the current market, and allows our software to stand out from competition. 

#### Project Statement
This project will begin on October 8, 2020, after the standup meeting, where User Stories and tasks will be selected and distributed among team members.

Our goal is to design and create a web application catered for anyone interested in expanding their analytical skills in sports, from casual fans to sports enthusiasts. This software will be built for SportCred.

## Requirements/Key Features
- Ability to debate with other users.

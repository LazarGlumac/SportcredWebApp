# Sprint 1 Restrospective Meeting

## Date and Time of Meeting
- Date: October 22, 2020
- Time: 10:10 to 11:00

## Participants
* Ryan Blasetti
* Aum Patel
* Parth Patel
* King Lai
* Lazar Glumac
* Jaedon Wong
* Yara Radwan

## Unfinished Tasks
* All tasks were finished this sprint

## Practices To Continue (What went well)
* Teamwork - Team members maintained a good line of communication to complete tasks in timely manner
* Perfect attendance - Team members showed up to every meeting on time
* Initiative - Team members took initiative to start the webpage to give others an idea of what the site will look like for their components
* Researching - Most people took time to thoroughly understand React language before beginning tasks
* Collaboration - Team members worked very well independently to complete tasks given with little overall supervision from overall team
* Completion - Team members were quick to develop the backend and maintain it throughout testing phases.

## New Practices To Start
* Pull master into personal branch first to debug code BEFORE merging to master (less problems later in the sprint)
* Starting earlier on work to avoid last minute crunch time and open line of communication for longer
* Firmer deadlines to ensure all work can be done when necessary so that the final test isn’t pushed so close to the demo
* Meaningful css to prevent overlapping of styles

## Harmful Practices (What went wrong)
* Lack of Modulation - Css overlapped due to miscommunication prolonging overall merge timing
* Poor Time Management - Team members took too long to start/finish making overall merge take a lot longer than necessary (too much last second work)
* Miscommunication - Members were not 100% on board with one another in certain features causing discrepancies that had to be fixed late in the sprint
* Lack of Revisions - Code produced was sometimes not adequately reviewed causing for many commits to fix said errors (extended debugging)

## Best Experience
* When trivia finally compiled during the demo and SPORTCRED Jacob complimented us on the trivia component saying “very well done” 

## Worst Experience
* Spending the last 3 days before the demo on call trying to compile the entirety of the code into one overall (catching bugs and finishing work)

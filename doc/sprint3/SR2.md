## Unfinished Tasks
* All tasks were finished this sprint

## Practices To Continue (What went well)
* Unity - Team members maintained a good line of communication to complete tasks in timely manner
* Commitment - Most people took time to thoroughly understand React language before beginning tasks
* Collaboration - Team members worked very well to complete tasks given with little overall supervision from overall team
* Completion - Team members were quick to develop the backend and maintain it throughout testing phases.

## New Practices To Start
* Demo Preparation - Ensure more members are equipped to demo the product so that it does not all depend on one person
* Give larger notices for meetings to ensure all members show up EXACTLY on time
* Beginning earilier on work to avoid last minute crunch time and open line of communications more
* Firmer deadlines to ensure all work can be done when necessary so that the final test isnâ€™t pushed so close to the demo

## Harmful Practices (What went wrong)
* Time Mismanagement - SPent extra time on tasks that were easier to complete causing a bulk of work to be done at once
* Revision History - Code produced was sometimes not adequately reviewed causing for many commits to fix said errors (extended debugging)
* Poor Communication - Members did not always communicate when issues has arisen making it harder to deal with them

## Best Experience
* Completing the practice demo 2 days in advance perfectly leaving no further revision before the demo

## Worst Experience
* Team member's internet went out right before the demo making it difficult to prepare adequately
